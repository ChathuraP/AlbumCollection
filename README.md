# AlbumCollection

## About The Project
This project is a sample for downloading a list of albums and artists from the `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` server and thenÂ displaying it as a list. Upon tapping on a single album, it will open a collection of thumbnail images that belong to the album. Furthermore, upon tapping on a thumbnail, it will download the full image and open in a separate view with zoom capability.
